Setup the database:
$ createdb liquid_feedback
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f core.sql liquid_feedback

Optionally insert demo data:
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f demo.sql liquid_feedback

Compile lf_update binary:
$ make

Ensure that "lf_update dbname=liquid_feedback" is called regularly!

It is required that lf_update is executed regulary (i.e. every
5 minutes via cron) to update cached supporter counts, to change
the state of issues when neccessary, and to calculate the result
of votings. If you wish, copy the created lf_update file to
/usr/local/bin or a similar directory.

On successful run, lf_update will not produce any output
and exit with code 0.

NOTE: When writing to the database, some INSERTs must be executed
      within the same transaction, e.g. issues can't exist without
      an initiative and vice versa.

To create an export file, which is containing all but private data,
you may use the lf_export shell-script:
$ lf_export liquid_feedback export.sql.gz

Refer to source code of function "delete_private_data"() to see,
which data gets deleted. If you need a different behaviour, please
copy the function and modify the lf_export shell script accordingly.

To uninstall the software, delete the lf_update binary
and drop the database by entering the following command:
$ dropdb liquid_feedback

Updating is done using the update scripts in the update/ directory.
Do not forget to make backups, before installing any updates.
After updating it is recommended to recreate the schema as follows
(assuming the database superuser is named "postgres"):
$ pg_dump --disable-triggers --data-only DATABASE_NAME > tmp.sql
$ dropdb DATABASE_NAME
$ createdb DATABASE_NAME
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f core.sql DATABASE_NAME
$ su postgres  # (execute following command as database superuser)
$ psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f tmp.sql DATABASE_NAME
$ exit         # leave "su" command
$ rm tmp.sql
